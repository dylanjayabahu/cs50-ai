Unsupervised Learning:
When we have data without labels; AI must learn patterns

Clustering: organizing objects into clusters 
    - e.g. grouping pixels of an image; grouping consumers in marketing research 

K-means clustering:
    - divide the data points into k clusters 
    - repeatedly assign points to clusters and updating the centers' clusters
        - a cluster is defined based on its center 
        - a point belongs to the cluster whose center is closest to it
        - when we update a cluster, we move its center to the average of all the points in that cluster 
        - repeat until the cluster centers converge
